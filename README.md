# PHMIC

In this study, we characterize two beta-lactamase enzymes with focus on the effect of pH on their activity. Beta-lactamases are enzymes that make bacteria resistant to some of the most common antibiotics used in medicine such as penicillins. By testing antibiotic susceptibility of isogenic E. coli strains engineered to express CTX-M-15, CMY-2 or both, at different pH's, we can show how the environment can effect resistance. From this we find that pH has a contrasting effect on activity of CTX-M-15 and CMY-2. 
The data included in this repository include minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data, growth kinetics at different pH's and concentrations of antibiotic, enzyme kinetics of both enzymes to nitrocefin, co-culture read mapping, and molecular dynamics data.
